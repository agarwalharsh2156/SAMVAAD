<h1> SAMVAAD </h1>
This is a proposed solution for the problem presented by the GSEB(Gujarat State Education Board). The problem was challenges faced by Deaf and Mute children practising sign language at their home away from the guidance of their instructors and teachers
hence, we propose a solution SAMVAAD :
- An Android application with child friendly interface.
- Not only learn but practice too
- A CNN empowered machine learning model running at the background for real-time sign evaluation.
- Memory and power efficient.

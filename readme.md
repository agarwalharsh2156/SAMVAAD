<h1> SAMVAAD </h1>
This is a proposed solution for the problem presented by the GSEB(Gujarat State Education Board). The problem was challenges faced by Deaf and Mute children practicing sign language at their homes away from the guidance of their instructors and teachers
hence, we propose a solution SAMVAAD :
- An Android application with child-friendly interface.<br>
- Not only learn but practice too<br>
- A CNN-empowered machine learning model runs in the background for real-time sign evaluation.<br>
- Memory and power efficient.
